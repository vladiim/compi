Competitor Intelligence

>SUB< 
Quick smarts

>INTRO< 
Competitor intelligence (CI) equips you with the insight to make strategic moves around what your marketplace is already doing. 

Part zeitgeist, part data science, CI gives your business an ear-to-the-ground competitive edge. 

>BODY 1<
Information aspiration

In the old days, companies gleaned their marketing insights from reams of reports and consumer surveys – a slow and expensive process. 

Today’s sophisticated competitor intelligence is inexpensive and fast. It uses a range of digital tools to create an accurate overview of your market and its opportunities:

•   What are my competitors doing?
•   Who are the market leaders? Why?
•   What are my competitor's strengths and weaknesses?
•   Is there an unmet need in the marketplace?

>BODY 2<
Business – not buzz

We’re here to get you clued-up on what's going on around you. 

We use data on web behaviour – site visits, web searches, social posts, app downloads – to yield some of the richest competitor intelligence insights available to your business:

Competitor behaviour
•   Website content – pages, topics, product prices
•   Website success – traffic, engagement, social shares, inflows and outflows

Customer behaviour
•   Quantitative intent – product and brand searches
•   Qualitative understanding – social comments and conversation




>BODY 3<
First one’s on us

Our easy-to-read reports contain everything you need to know in a single-page download. No trivial jargon, pointless infographics, clunky paragraphs or buzzword bingo. And the first one is free. 

Here’s what to expect:

•   Describe actual service / report (use a different word for ‘report’?) 
•   What can they expect? How often?
•   What is the benefit of signing up right now?
